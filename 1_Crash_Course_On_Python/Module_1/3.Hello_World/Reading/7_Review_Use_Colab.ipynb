The code cells include executable code and rich text which make it easy to write and run code. Colab also makes it easy to include markdown in your notebooks. This is a great feature for sharing notebooks because you can add headings, paragraphs, lists, mathematical formulas, and more. You can install Python packages using the pip command within the code cell. Colab Notebooks can easily be shared with other collaborators, too. \n",
