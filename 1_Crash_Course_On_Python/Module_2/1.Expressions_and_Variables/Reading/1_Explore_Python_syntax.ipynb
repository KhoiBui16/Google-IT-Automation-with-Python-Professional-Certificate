Together, the words and punctuation communicate ideas and processes; this is known as semantics. Semantics is the meaning conveyed by the syntax. The best way to learn syntax and semantics is through exposure. Practice coding and become familiar and comfortable with reading other people’s code. In addition, there are some general conventions that practitioners use to help maintain stylistic uniformity within the language. "

If you learn the rules about naming objects and build a bank of resources that you can reference for guidance, you’ll surely make progress as a Python learner.
